🖼️ Picture Choice — Overview

Purpose:
It’s a visual vocabulary exercise that teaches learners to connect Sinhala words or phrases with the correct image.
It’s one of the simplest, most intuitive lesson types — great for reinforcing meaning through visual association.

🧠 How it Works (Step-by-Step)

Prompt appears at the top

This can be either:

An English word/phrase → “dog”

Or a Sinhala word → “බල්ලා (ballā)”

Depending on lesson direction (English → Sinhala or Sinhala → English).

Four image options are displayed in a grid below.

Only one image correctly represents the prompt.

The rest are distractors (related or random objects).

Learner clicks on the image they think matches.

The chosen card briefly highlights (hover + click animation).

If correct → image flashes green ✅

If incorrect → image flashes red ❌ and the correct one glows green.

Feedback appears (“Correct!” or “That was [X], not [Y].”)

A short delay (≈ 1.5 sec), then it auto-advances to the next prompt.

🎮 Example

Prompt:

“බල්ලා”

Choices:
🐶 Dog (correct)
🐱 Cat
🐘 Elephant
🐓 Chicken

Learner clicks the dog → it flashes green → next question loads.

💾 Data Structure (Simplified Example)

The JSON for this kind of exercise might look like this:

{
  "type": "picture-choice",
  "prompts": [
    {
      "question": "බල්ලා",
      "correct": "dog.jpg",
      "options": ["dog.jpg", "cat.jpg", "elephant.jpg", "chicken.jpg"],
      "translation": "Dog"
    },
    {
      "question": "අපේ රට",
      "correct": "sri_lanka.jpg",
      "options": ["sri_lanka.jpg", "india.jpg", "china.jpg", "japan.jpg"],
      "translation": "Our country"
    }
  ]
}

🧩 Integration in the LessonSimulator

Each Picture Choice prompt runs as one exercise “slide.”

When the learner answers correctly (or after correction), the exercise calls onComplete() to advance to the next one.

The module is self-contained and lives at:
assets/Lessons/exercises/PictureChoice/index.js

💡 Teaching Value

Builds word-image association quickly, which is vital for beginners.

Great for nouns, animals, foods, objects, and actions.

Works well as one of the first exercise types in any new lesson unit.

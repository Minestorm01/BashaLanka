Perfect — let’s visualise Lesson 01: “Pronouns + Yes/No Basics” as it would appear in a Picture Choice exercise.

Below are the kinds of images you’d prepare for the vocabulary items — what they’d show, and why they fit.

🖼️ Lesson 01 — Picture Choice Image Concepts
Sinhala	English meaning	What the picture should show	Notes / style
මම (mama – I)	“I / me”	A single person pointing to themselves, hand on chest or finger toward chest.	Simple neutral-gender illustration or photo. Works best if consistent art style (flat, friendly, Duolingo-style).
ඔයා (oyā – you)	“you (casual)”	Person pointing directly at viewer / camera.	Make eye contact, smiling — clear “you” cue.
ඒයා (eyā – they / he / she)	“they / he / she (neutral)”	A small group of two-three people standing together, or one gender-neutral figure waving.	Avoid gender bias; stylised icons help.
ඔව් (owu – yes)	“yes”	Green check ✅, thumbs-up 👍, or person nodding.	The concept of agreement / affirmation.
නෑ (nae – no)	“no”	Red cross ❌, head-shake gesture, or person crossing arms.	Contrast visually with “ඔව්”.
හොඳයි (hondayi – fine / good)	“fine / good”	Smiling face, sunshine, or person giving a relaxed OK gesture.	Warm colours; conveys positive state.
📦 How They’d Be Used in the Exercise

Each prompt would pick one Sinhala word and show four possible images — one correct, three distractors.
Example question sets:

Prompt	Correct image	Distractors
“ඔව්” (Yes)	✅ Thumbs-up	❌ Cross, 🤷 Person pointing, 🙂 Smiling face
“නෑ” (No)	❌ Crossed arms	✅ Thumbs-up, 🙂 Smiling face, 👥 Group of people
“මම” (I)	Person pointing to self	Person pointing outward, Group of people, Check mark
“ඔයා” (You)	Person pointing outward	Person pointing to self, Cross mark, Group
“හොඳයි” (Fine/Good)	Relaxed smiling person	Angry face, Thumbs-down, Question mark
“ඒයා” (They)	Small group of two-three	One person, Check mark, Smiling sun
🎨 Design Notes

Keep all pictures uniform (same dimensions and background, preferably transparent PNGs or SVGs).

Use friendly, expressive characters or icons — Duolingo/Flat-illustration style.

Background: soft pastel gradient or solid light colour (to fit BashaLanka’s green-teal theme).

File names should match lesson ID for easy mapping, e.g.:

lesson-01_oya.png
lesson-01_eyaa.png
lesson-01_owu.png
lesson-01_nae.png

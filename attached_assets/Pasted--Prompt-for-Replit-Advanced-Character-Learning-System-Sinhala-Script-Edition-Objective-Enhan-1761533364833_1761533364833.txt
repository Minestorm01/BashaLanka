🦁 Prompt for Replit — Advanced Character Learning System (Sinhala Script Edition)

Objective:
Enhance the existing Characters view in BashaLanka by turning it into an interactive, gamified tool — similar to Duolingo’s new Japanese writing-system learning feature.
This should fit naturally into the existing BashaLanka UI (using the current design, not a rebuild) while adding new functionality, interactivity, and polish.

1. Core Concept

We’re implementing a Character Learning Hub for Sinhala that mirrors the experience described in Duolingo’s Japanese system:

Visual, interactive character charts for Sinhala vowels, consonants, and combined forms.

Users can trace, match, listen, and identify Sinhala letters to master reading and recognition.

Each character visually “lights up” or animates as the user masters it.

A progress tracker shows how many letters are mastered, in progress, or new.

2. Integration Requirements

Keep and enhance the existing Characters UI, not replace it.
This means:

Maintain the current layout and filtering (All, Vowels, Consonants, Combined Forms).

Rework the inner logic to use a new structured JSON data model (already reworked characters.json).

Add interactive layers and visual feedback animations similar to Duolingo’s tabs for hiragana / katakana / kanji.

3. Functional Additions

Each character card should now support these new features:

🖊️ Tracing Mode

Add a tracing overlay canvas where users can draw the Sinhala letter using their mouse or finger (touch-friendly).

The drawn path should briefly show a success animation if it roughly matches the shape outline (tolerance-based check).

🔊 Pronunciation Practice

Add a “Listen & Repeat” button for each character.

Uses the existing Sinhala audio if available; fallback to a generated voice (if SpeechSynthesis API works).

Later expansion: speech recognition scoring for user pronunciation.

🎮 Gamified Mastery System

Characters light up or pulse when mastered.

Track progress (New → Learning → Mastered) in localStorage.

Optionally add a streak bonus for mastering multiple in a row.

Progress ring or small glowing badge per character.

🧩 Mini-Exercises

Within the Characters view (not full LessonSimulator):

Matching mini-game (match Sinhala to Romanized).

Quick multiple-choice quiz (“Which sound is this letter?”).

Listening quiz (“Click the letter you heard”).

These appear as small pop-up modals or inline cards so users can practice per letter without leaving the Characters screen.

4. Visual + UX Goals

Make it clean, beautiful, and consistent with the BashaLanka design.

Use existing fonts, rounded cards, and shadows from styles.features.css.

Subtle glass-like background or gradient panels (like the home page).

Smooth hover animations, progress color gradients (teal → orange → gold as mastery increases).

Keep accessibility (keyboard focus + aria labels) intact.

5. JSON & Data Model

Use the reworked assets/data/characters.json structure:

{
  "vowels": [{ "char": "අ", "roman": "a", "audio": "a.mp3" }],
  "consonants": [{ "char": "ක", "roman": "ka", "audio": "ka.mp3" }],
  "combined": [{ "char": "කා", "roman": "kā", "base": "ක", "vowel": "ා" }]
}


Each character’s progress should be stored locally like:

{
  "අ": { "status": "mastered", "score": 0.95 },
  "ක": { "status": "learning", "score": 0.5 }
}

6. Stretch Goals (Phase 2)

After the base features work:

Add a Character Progress Overview Modal (bar graph of mastery).

Introduce daily character goals integrated into the Quests system.

Optional: integrate tracing data as XP gain.

7. Summary of Implementation Tasks
Feature	Description
Interactive Charts	Make each character clickable and animated
Tracing Canvas	Add stroke-based drawing for recognition practice
Audio & Pronunciation	Add listen/repeat support per character
Mini-Exercises	Add small quiz + matching games within the Characters view
Progress Tracking	Persist mastery per character in localStorage
Visual Polish	Smooth animations, glowing mastery effects
Data Source	Use updated characters.json for structure

Important:
All of this must integrate seamlessly into the existing BashaLanka Characters page layout — no breaking or replacing the UI, only enriching it.
